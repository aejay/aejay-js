# @aejay/prettier-config

A [prettier](https://prettier.io/) config with Aejay's current opinion's baked
in. These will probably change over time, so please don't judge me too harshly
for them!

Look at the [configuration file](./index.json) if you're curious to know what
this involves.

## Using this config

If you somehow happen to share my exact opinions, you should be able to use this
config by specifying this in your package.json:

```json
{
  // ...
  "prettier": "@aejay/prettier-config"
}
```
